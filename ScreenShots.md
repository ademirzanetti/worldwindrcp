The following screen shot shows the main Geobrowser GUI. Notice the typical look and feel of Eclipse RCP. There are two main views: 1) The Earth view, which conctains the World Wind OpenGL canvas, and 2) the Layers View, which lists WW built-in layers and custom user defined layers.

The screen shot bellow shows the wizard interface to the NOAA real time weather servers
(essentially an HTTP server with a bunch of time encoded images). The wizard lets the user pick a data set, as well as time dimensions and image format. The result will be shown as an animated overlay of images (similar in concept to the time based ground overlays of KML).

The Geobrowser supports **animated overlays**. The screen bellow shows the dataset "Hurricanes 2005: Clouds and Sea Surface Temperature" from the NASA Scientific Visualization Studio (SVS) WMS Server.

The last screen shot on the lot shows the built-in web browser, which is capable of detecting KML links and displaying them on the Earth view.
