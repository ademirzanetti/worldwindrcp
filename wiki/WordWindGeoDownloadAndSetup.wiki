= Downloading and building your own distro =

World Wind Geo has been enhanced with an Analytics perpextive as described in the Wiki. However, there is not enough space to upload the new binaries. This page explains how to download the source and build a binary distro for your OS.

= Details =

You can use Eclipse to download the source from the SVN server and build a binary that includes the analytics perpective:

==To Download the source==

  * Install a eclipse SVN plugin (if not available). A popular one is Subeclipse from http://subclipse.tigris.org/
  * Within eclipse, open the SVN repository view: Window/Show View/Other/SVN/ SVN Repository
  * Create a new repository location to http://worldwindrcp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ using the wizard easy steps
  * Check out the source projects: org.eclipse.plugin.WorldWind and org.eclipse.plugin.Analytics
  * At this point you can open the product descriptor (WorldWind.product within the WordWind project) and run the RCP application by clicking "Launch an Eclipse application"
  * The run will fail due to the missing OpenGL & Java 3D natives. Thus open the run config (Run/Open Run dialog) and add the following arguments to the "VM aguments" section of the arguments tab: -Xmx256m -Djava.library.path=${resource_loc:org.eclipse.plugin.WorldWind}/lib/native/win32
  * Now the application shouls start successfully. Play around with the analytics perpective and use the help to read thru and download some test data files.

==To build a distro==
  * You will need to install the Eclipse delta pack. It allows you to build binaries for different OSes.
