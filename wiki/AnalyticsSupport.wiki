= Analytics support =

We are planing to add an Analytics plugin for our RCP app. With the following features:

 * A view for the VisAD spreadsheet - http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~curtis/ss.html. This view will support VisAD formats: Vis5D, COARDS NetCDF, DODS, etc.

 * A view for the EPA Models-3 Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Modeling System NetCDF format, using software developed by ANL dubbed Visualization Environment for Rich Data Interpretation (VERDI).

A new Analytics Plugin has been built with 2 eclipse views:

 * VisAD SpreadSheet view.
 * Models3/Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) view.


== VisAD SpreadSheet ==
The VisAD SpreadSheet is a program that utilizes VisAD to visualize data sets and do simple computations, without forcing the user to do any Java programming (see http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~curtis/ss.html).

Here is a screen shot of the spreadsheet.

The main panel of the spreadsheet has been integrated as a Eclipse view into a new Analytics Plugin for the World Wind Geobrowser.

== Visualization Environment for Rich Data Interpretation (VERDI)==
The EPA needs for a software tool to visualize scientific data and model output. Currently, the EPA user community utilizes the Package for Analysis and Visualization of Environmental Data (PAVE) for this purpose.  PAVE is a Unix-based software system written in C and Motif. Argonne National Laboratory has developed this tool in support of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Here is a screen shot of the main VERDI GUI:

Verdi is capable of reading Models3/CMAQ data only. It is a powefurl tool to create formulas and to display many plot types as shown in the next screen shot:

More documentation on VERDI is available from the downloads section of this site.

== Conclusion ==
The combination of both: VisAD and VERDI provides a powerful numerical analysis plugin to the World Wind Geobrowser capable on handling most modeling data formats.
