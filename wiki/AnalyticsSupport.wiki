= Analytics support =

We are planing to add an Analytics plugin for our RCP app. With the following features:

 * A view for the VisAD spreadsheet - http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~curtis/ss.html. This view will support VisAD formats: Vis5D, COARDS NetCDF, DODS, etc.

 * A view for the EPA Models-3 Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Modeling System NetCDF format, using software developed by ANL dubbed Visualization Environment for Rich Data Interpretation (VERDI).


= Details =

A new Analytics Plugin has been built with 2 eclipse views:

 * VisAD SpreadSheet view.
 * Models3/Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) view.


== VisAD SpreadSheet ==
The VisAD SpreadSheet is a program that utilizes VisAD to visualize data sets and do simple computations, without forcing the user to do any Java programming (see http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~curtis/ss.html).

Here is a screen shot of the spreadsheet.

The main panel of the spreadsheet has been integrated as a Eclipse view into a new Analytics Plugin for the World Wind Geobrowser.
